My name is Ayman mostafa. I am a Front-end developer based from Egypt with a Bachelor of Management Informations Systems (MIS) degree from the [El Shorouk Academy (Egypt)](https://hicit.sha.edu.eg/department-mis.php) and more than 5 years of IT experience. I love building and seeing projects come to life. I love front-end development the most! Currently just completed a fully remote apprenticeship program with Microsoft Leap and now transitioned as a full-time Software Engineer at Microsoft.

üå± **Learning**: Currently sharpening my JavaScript, TypeScript and React skills. Practicing said skills by building a small project called [Taskies](https://github.com/tolentinoel/Typescript_taskies) -- a to-do list app built from Typescript!<br/>
üí° **Fun fact**: I am a percussion aficionado, my most favorite instruments are the drums ü•Å and acoustic guitar.
